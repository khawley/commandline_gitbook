# Paths

A path is simply the list of directories you need to go through to get to a folder or file.  When chained together, we can follow them to our destination.

In unix based operating systems (Mac/Linux), directories in a path are joined by a `/`.

The previous example showed my current directory as `/Users/kelseyhawley`.  To get to the that folder, I would need to open `Users`, then `kelseyhawley`.

Before moving forward, we're going to cover some of the more common vocabulary used to describe paths.
