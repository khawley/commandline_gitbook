# Relative Path

Unlike _absolute paths_, a _relative path_ will **not** start with a `/`.  They require you be in a specific folder in order for it to make sense.

If I said my path was `kelseyhawley`, would you know that you had to be in the `/Users` folder to get there?  No.  So `kelseyhawley` is a _relative path_.  It is _relative_ to your current location.

Examples of a _relative path_:

- `kelseyhawley`
- `../kelseyhawley`
- `./kelseyhawley`
