# Command Structure

Before we start running commands, its important to understand their basic structure.

```
<command_name> <flags> <arguments>
```

The _command_ is the name of the command to run, like `pwd`.

The _flags_ are optional pieces to be passed to the command and are denoted by a `-` or `--`, such as `-a` or `--all`.  Each command has a preset list of flags you can use.

The _arguments_ are optional pieces to be passed to the command, like flags, but are not preset values.  An example is a filename, like `readme.txt`.

You should also be aware that the order _matters_ when typing a command.  The _flags_ should always come **after** the _command_name_, and **before** any _arguments_.
